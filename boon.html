	<h2 id="wic" style="color:lime">What is Coronavirus?</h2>
	<p style="color:#c04769">Corona, a name everyone is way too familiar with these days, except the toddlers,obviously! We never in our wildest dreams could have imagined that a microbe will bring death to thousands of people taking a form of<b> pandemic</b>. We were trying to outstand each other's powerful bombs and missiles collection and now we are struck in our houses with none of those(bomb and missiles) to come to our rescue. We never heard our names being called in our life so much as we have heard the term <b> Corona </b> in the last few months. The whole world is locked in their homes, countries under total lockdown. We are witnsessing a global pause, in a simple language to call it.<b> Novel Corona virus or covid-19 </b>, as you may call it, was first spotted in a small town <b> Wuhan, China</b>.</p>

	<p style="color:#c04769"> It was first discovered in <b> november 2019 </b> and it took around two months to realize how terrifying this thing was. Being contagious made it worse, the symptoms appearing like a common cough and cold, taking a fortnight to discover if one is actually contaminated. In the meantime, a new lot comes forward being affected. This chain reaction soon engulfed countries with even the best medical facilities, killing thousands in a week.</p>

	<h2 id="nac" style="color:lime">Nature And Corona.</h2>
	<p style="color:#c04769">But hey! Every coin has two sides: good and bad. Corona is no different. Infact, it has come out as a boon for our earth. The humans really created havoc globally, be it pollution, population, global warming, deforestation and what not! But as we are staying in our homes now, trapped within the walls, nature is returning to its better form, its healing. There have been evidences world wide showing how lots of species have returned to their native places. Be it sea animals, birds or animals on land, the nature seems happy again. The climatic contiditions are changing, pollution rates have dropped low, skies are clearer tham it was ever in the last few decades, air is pure, ozone has healed itself and what not! Why not have a glimps of some of these beauties?  </p>

	<p style="color:#c04769"><b> "While we are panicking about covid-19, Mother Earth is healing,"</b></p>

	<p align="center" style="color:#c04769">The earth has been healing itself while we stay locked down in our houses. There are reports of Ganges water being sparkling clean, the Himalayas being visible from towns in Punjab, ozone layer sealing, air quality index improving significantly. All this shows the power nature possesses to make things right. It also gives us an opportunity.</p>

	<p align="center"style="color:#c04769">While it is debatable whether this is an outcome of the coronavirus pandemic only, for the lack of any stronger correlation it is safe to assume that at least partially it is. And hence, if all it took for the earth to heal was a month and half of no human intervention, it shows the power nature possesses to make things right; and the power humans possess to just make them wrong.</p>

	<p align="center" style="color:#c04769">Yudhishtir had told Yaksha that the biggest irony of life is that we encounter people dying every day and yet live like immortals. One of the many reflections of this thought is the incessant plundering of nature done by mankind, under the false notion of being invincible and superior; overlooking the dependency on that very nature for survival. The medical systems of the first world countries of the EU and USA are collapsing under the COVID-19 impact, and it is for us to realize how small and helpless we are if the cosmos decides to take over.</P>

	<h2 style="color:lime">Rivers</h2>
	<p style="color:#c04769">You can see the surface of river Ganga, which could not be cleaned despite spending crores of rupees is now cleaner than ever as reportedly none of the industrial waste is being dumped in it. According to a report in HT, Ganga may be cleaner today, than it was in 1986 — the year when efforts to clean the river were first launched. And, a similar case is with Yamuna. Due to a blanket reduction in industrial pollutants, and increased discharge of water from Haryana to Delhi, a cleaner Yamuna is visible these says. Both the factors have increased the self purification capacity of the river.</p>

	<h2 style="color:lime">Clear skies, and clearer skyline</h2>
	<p style="color:#c04769">With absolutely limited movement of vehicles on the roads, most of the metro cities in India are breathing in much cleaner air with relatively safer levels of pollutants to deal with, as compared to the time before the lockdown. Metro cities have reported satisfactory AQI, and those who had been battling smog in Delhi-NCR can vouch for it anytime!The Dhauladhar range of HImalayan mountains as viewed from the city of Jalandhar, Punjab, due to a steep drop in the pollution levels on day 10 of the initial 21-day lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus.</P>

	<h2 style="color:lime">Feathers flock together</h2>
	<p style="color:#c04769">The news of pink flamingoes return in huge numbers to Mumbai beach is certainly something to rejoice about. The reduction in intensity of human activities at and around the city is being touted as a major reason for the possibility of flamingos to flock the city in such large numbers. The Bombay Natural History Society has stated that their number is 25% more than it was in the last year.</p>
